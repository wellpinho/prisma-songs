# Prisma + Next.js Starter

Starter project for [Next.js + Prisma Tutorial](https://leerob.io/blog/next-prisma).

See the completed example [here](https://github.com/leerob/next-prisma).

## Requirements

- Node 10+
- Yarn (or NPM if you prefer)

## Getting Started

After cloning the repository, you can run `yarn` to install the dependencies and then start the application with `yarn dev`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leerob/next-prisma-starter.git
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

You are now able to view the application at http://localhost:3000. This starter uses fake data to begin the structure of the application. To verify it's working correctly, you should see:

- `/` â€“ The index route should show "Test Song"
- `/songs/1` - The song page should show a hardcoded YouTube embed
